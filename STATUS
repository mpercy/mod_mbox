Release history:

    0.2     : released ? ?, ? [SoC]
    0.1     : released July 17, 2001

Release showstoppers:

ToDo:

    * Documentation
      - For developpers : internals
      - For users       : usage, interface description, ...

    * Better page selector (useful for 10+ pages archives)

    * Restore browser compatibility

    * Take care of mbox_externals :
      * Remove built-in apr_date_rfc() replacement when the fixed version
        will be packaged and distributed in common distros.
      * Remove built-in ap_strcasestr() when HTTPd's one have been moved
        to the APR (as apr_strcasestr ?).
      
Wish list:

    * Better integration with httpd-2.0 build system.
    * Interface internationalization
    * Better XML semantics ?
    * Use Javascript object-oriented features
    * When viewing a message, come back to the page we came instead of
      the first page of the choosen listing (without cookie, if
      possible)

Compatibility problems:

    The AJAX browsing interface is only known to work with Gecko based
    browsers. It has been successfully tested with :

      * Firefox 1.0.4, 1.0.5 and 1.0.6
      * Firefox Deep Park Alpha 2
      * Epiphany-browser 1.6.4
      * Galeon 1.3.21

    Internet Explorer:

      * _msglist is not considered as defined in the
        drawFullMsgList() function. Still, it should have been set by
	getMsgList() just before the call to drawFullMsgList().
      * local variable scope is not supported. the
        parseMimeStructure() function will *not* work.

    Safari:

      * Browser crashes when calling toggleMessage(). Some debugging
        did not help locating the bug (sometimes in the
        toggleMessage() function, sometimes in the
        buildMessageListEntry() function ...)

    Konqueror:

      * KHTML does not support AJAX. Some strange errors related to
        .innerHTML, but I was not able to reproduce them outside
        mod_mbox (http://skikda.bulix.org/~sam/ajax/compat.html).

    Opera:

      * The AJAX browsing interface does not work. All the data is
        here and loaded, but it's displayed as if the browser did not
        even care of the generated XHTML content.
