The files in here are what are used to maintain the apachelabs.org
mbox archive repository.  They may not work, or they just might.  Enjoy!

Some of these scripts were originally for internal use at eBuilt.

create-archive-list:  Create the mbox-archvies.list from fetched copy
catchup-archive:      Reindex a list from raw rsync (.gz and .mbox files only)
update-index:         Hourly (or more) script to process current month's mbox
update-index-monthly: Handles the month transition.
create-index:         Creates per-list index page
search-msgid:         CGI script for searching for a particular msgid
fetch-archive-list:   Fetch current list dirs from rsync master (obsolete)

To sync new lists:

1. create-archive-list ~jerenkrantz/archives/raw > ~jerenkrantz/archives/mbox-archives.list

To recreate the archives from the master copy (i.e. changed master mbox files):

1. wait for rsync (update-index) to sync up the master archives
2. rm -rf ~jerenkrantz/archives/mod_mbox/$list
3. catchup-archive $list
